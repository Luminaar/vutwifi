vutwifi
===============
Connect to WIFI at FIT VUT in Brno.

Install ::

    pip install vutwifi

Run ::

    vutwifi connect

We recommend that you create a configuration file in ``~/.vutwifi.conf``,
like this.

::

    user = pycon
    password = pycon2015cz

Alternatively, you may set the user and password on the command line. ::

    vutwifi connect -user pycon -password pycon2015cz

If you do neither of these, ``vutwifi`` will prompt for the user and
password. ::

    vutwifi connect
    Username: pycon
    Password: pycon2015cz

Note: vutwifi requires Python version 3.3 or higher.
